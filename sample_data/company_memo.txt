TechFlow Solutions - Investment Memo

Company Overview:
TechFlow Solutions is a B2B SaaS company founded in 2022 by Sarah Chen (CEO) and Michael Rodriguez (CTO), both former senior engineers at Google and Amazon respectively. The company has developed an innovative workflow automation platform that helps mid-market companies streamline their business processes through intelligent automation and AI-powered decision making.

Mission and Vision:
Our mission is to democratize enterprise-grade workflow automation for companies that can't afford expensive enterprise solutions. We believe that every company, regardless of size, should have access to tools that can eliminate repetitive tasks and improve operational efficiency.

The Problem We Solve:
Mid-market companies (50-500 employees) are stuck between expensive enterprise solutions like ServiceNow ($50K+ annual contracts) and basic tools like Zapier that lack the sophistication needed for complex business processes. These companies lose countless hours on manual workflows, face compliance risks due to human error, and struggle to scale operations efficiently.

Our Solution:
TechFlow's platform combines visual workflow design with AI-powered decision engines. Key features include:
- Drag-and-drop workflow builder with 200+ pre-built templates
- AI-powered document processing and data extraction
- Intelligent routing and approval systems
- Real-time analytics and performance monitoring
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance (SOC 2, GDPR)

Market Opportunity:
The workflow automation market is projected to reach $78.5 billion by 2026, growing at 23.5% CAGR. Our target segment (mid-market B2B SaaS) represents approximately $12 billion of this market. We're positioned to capture 1-2% market share within 5 years, representing a $120-240 million revenue opportunity.

Competitive Landscape:
Direct competitors include Zapier (limited to simple integrations), Microsoft Power Automate (complex enterprise focus), and UiPath (RPA-focused). We differentiate through our focus on mid-market needs, superior user experience, and AI-powered intelligence that competitors lack.

Sarah Chen (CEO) - 8 years at Google, led teams of 50+ engineers, MBA from Stanford
